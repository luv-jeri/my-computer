Always use context7 when:

- Code generation is needed
- Setup or configuration steps are required
- Library or API documentation is needed
- Working with any external library or framework

This means automatically use the Context7 MCP tools (resolve-library-id and get-library-docs) to fetch up-to-date documentation without being explicitly asked.
